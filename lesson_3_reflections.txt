Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because there are always experimental code and incomplete code that might be on commits..

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is a feature available only on github and it is used to clone another repository
clone is to duplicate a repository, on github or locally
branch is when you start doing a new feature and you branch out your git tree

i use branch when i want to make a new feature
clone when i want to duplicate an existing repository (online or local)
fork is when i wanna duplicate an existing repository on github to my github to keep the credits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

to know if we should merge or commit new updates.
